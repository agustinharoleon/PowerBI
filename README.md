# 📊 Power BI Projects

Welcome to my **Power BI portfolio**. This repository contains exercises and dashboards I've developed to strengthen my data analysis and visualization skills using Power BI.

Each folder represents a different topic, business case, or domain, and includes:

- Power BI reports (`.pbix`)
- Source data files (`.xlsx`, `.csv`, etc.)
- Screenshots of dashboards
- A dedicated `README.md` explaining each project
